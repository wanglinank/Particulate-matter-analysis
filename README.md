### pollutantmean.R calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors
### complete.R reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data file
### corr.R takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold
